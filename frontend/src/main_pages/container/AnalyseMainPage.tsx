                        <p>Here the used ontologies and the included synonym/search words are presented. For this analysis, Pubmed abstracts (last upd. January 2018) have been searched for the below listed terms.</p>
                        <p>As always, this analysis is not static. Many ideas can be implemented. When the results are almost correct, updating the pubmed database is anticipated.</p>
